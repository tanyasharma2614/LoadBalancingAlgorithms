Load Balancing Algorithms

Our goal is to assess and evaluate various load balancing techniques by measuring their performance based on relevant performance metrics. Typically, Load Balancing is accomplished through conventional techniques such as round-robin, random, and weighted round-robin. However, in this particular project, we aim to introduce a novel approach by utilizing heaps to achieve Load Balancing in a Network.
